and the POC demo.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
number of team meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended over the time
period of interest.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in
the team's repo. You can find the number of lectures in the time period of
interest by looking at the

Name 3 & Num & \% \\
Name 4 & Num & \% \\
Name 5 & Num & \% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
multi-author commits.}

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\section{CICD}

At a high level, our CI/CD uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests (build.tex/compile-latex) on every pull request, and to build the project in a clean environment. Branch protection rules block merges until checks pass and at least one reviewer approves. This ensures new changes don’t break or regress existing functionality and remain deployable with consistent quality.


\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}


There are no team charter trigger items to date. The team has made good progress, but consistency in work ethic needs improvement to ensure on‑time completion. A GitHub issue has been opened to revise the team charter and address this.
