\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.

\section{Demo Plans}

In our demonstration, we will show the complete user interaction flow. The user provides an audio input, which the system processes and converts into a specific goal or command. The system then presents this goal to the user for confirmation. Once the user confirms, the system proceeds to execute the command on their behalf, automating the task in the browser. The demo will display each step of this process, from input to confirmation to successful task completion.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 8\\
Kelvin Yu & 8\\
Luna Aljammal & 8\\
Mazen Youssef & 8\\
Rawan Mahdi & 8\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The team held 8 formal meetings during this period. There was a pause until after exams, but we continued to provide updates through messages and also reviewed work together outside of these formal meetings.

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}


\noindent \textbf{Supervisor's Name: Dr.Christian Brodbeck and Pavel Volgarev } 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 2\\
Kelvin Yu & 2\\
Luna Aljammal & 2\\
Mazen Youssef & 2\\
Rawan Mahdi & 2\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Lecture Attendance}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Kelvin Yu & 0\\
Luna Aljammal & 1\\
Mazen Youssef & 1\\
Rawan Mahdi & 0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Two team members attended the lecture to ensure we were able to gather the necessary information, which was then shared with the team.

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
% with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

\noindent \textbf{TA's Name:  Tanya Djavaherpour}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 0\\
Kelvin Yu & 0\\
Luna Aljammal & 0\\
Mazen Youssef & 0\\
Rawan Mahdi & 0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The TA document discussion was cancelled due to the snow day. Since we didn’t have any specific questions to discuss, no meeting took place during this period.

\section{Commits}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 102 & 100\% \\
Kelvin Yu & 10 & 9.8\% \\
Luna Aljammal & 42 & 41.2\% \\
Mazen Youssef & 23 & 22.6\% \\
Rawan Mahdi & 27 & 26.5\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These commit counts cover all work since the PoC, including documentation and feedback resolution from earlier tasks. 
Some team members had more, smaller commits, so total counts do not fully reflect the balanced contributions across development and documentation.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Luna & 14 & 19 \\
Kelvin & 7 & 14 \\
Mazen & 11 & 17 \\
Rawan & 9  & 26 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The difference in the Authored column is attributed to the creation of team meeting issues, which contributes significantly to the counts for some members. 



\section{CICD}

Two GitHub Actions workflows run on the \texttt{main} branch for both push and pull events:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{buildtex}: Triggered when files under \texttt{docs/**} change. This workflow builds the modified \LaTeX{} files into PDF artifacts and commits the generated PDFs back to the \texttt{main} branch.
    \item \textbf{Python CI}: Triggered when \texttt{.py} files, \texttt{requirements.txt}, or the workflow configuration change. This workflow uses Python~3.11 and runs \texttt{pylint} and \texttt{pytest} to validate code quality and correctness.
\end{itemize}


\section{Team Charter Trigger Items}

The following quantified triggers are established in our team charter:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Meeting Attendance:} All members are expected to attend every meeting unless they have communicated in advance.
    \item \textbf{Timely Task Updates:} Assigned tasks should be completed on time or any delays must be communicated ahead through Discord.
    \item \textbf{Review Before Merge:} No code or document changes may be merged without review and approval from at least one other team member.
\end{itemize}

There have been no violations of the team charter triggers during this reporting period. As no violations have occurred, no corrective actions are currently necessary.
