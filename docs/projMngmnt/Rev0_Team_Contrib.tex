\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the Rev 0
Demo.  The time period of interest is the time between the PoC demo and the Rev
0 demo; the contributions prior to the PoC are NOT included.

\section{Demo Plans}

In our demonstration, we will show the complete user interaction flow. The user provides an audio input, which the system processes and converts into a specific goal or command. The system then presents this goal to the user for confirmation. Once the user confirms, the system proceeds to execute the command on their behalf, automating the task in the browser. The demo will display each step of this process, from input to confirmation to successful task completion.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

The team held 8 formal meetings during this period. There was a pause until after exams, but we continued to provide updates through messages and also reviewed work together outside of these formal meetings.

Two team members attended the lecture to ensure we were able to gather the necessary information, which was then shared with the team.

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
% with the TA were attended over the time period of interest.}

The TA document discussion was cancelled due to the snow day. Since we didn’t have any specific questions to discuss, no meeting took place during this period.

\section{Commits}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 102 & 100\% \\
Kelvin Yu & 10 & 9.8\% \\
Luna Aljammal & 42 & 41.2\% \\
Mazen Youssef & 23 & 22.6\% \\
Rawan Mahdi & 27 & 26.5\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These commit counts cover all work since the PoC, including documentation and feedback resolution from earlier tasks. 
Some team members had more, smaller commits, so total counts do not fully reflect the balanced contributions across development and documentation.

\section{Issue Tracker}

\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Name 1 & Num & Num \\
Name 2 & Num & Num \\
Name 3 & Num & Num \\
Name 4 & Num & Num \\
Name 5 & Num & Num \\
\bottomrule
