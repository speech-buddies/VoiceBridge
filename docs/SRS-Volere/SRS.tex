\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}


Individuals with speech impairments face significant barriers when interacting with digital devices. VoiceBridge addresses this gap by providing an accurate, inclusive, and accessible speech-to-control system that enables users to communicate with their devices using their speech, regardless of clarity of articulation. Building on familiar technology, such as personal computers and mobile devices, may be one of the most cost-effective and easily adoptable approaches for improving an individual with disability’s autonomy and access to the world around them. The rise of ASR technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrations in the industry provides a novel landscape of opportunities to improve accessibility interfaces. VoiceBridge exploits bleeding-edge technology for a practical and impactful application.

\subsection{Technical Terminology}
\textbf{ASR} - Automatic Speech Recognition \\
\textbf{TTS} - Text To Speech \\
\textbf{STT} - Speech To Text \\


\subsection{Medical Terminology}
\textbf{Aphasia} - A condition that robs you of the ability to communicate. It can affect your ability to speak, write and understand language, both verbal and written. Aphasia usually occurs suddenly after a stroke or a head injury. But it can also come on gradually, as in the case of a brain tumor or a progressive neurological disease. \\
\textbf{ALS} - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis \\
\textbf{Dysarthria} - A motor speech disorder that makes it hard to speak. It is caused by damage to the nervous system, which can affect the muscles used for speaking. People with dysarthria may have slurred or slow speech, and they may have difficulty controlling the pitch, volume, and rhythm of their speech. \\
