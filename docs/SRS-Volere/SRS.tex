\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}


Individuals with speech impairments face significant barriers when interacting with digital devices. VoiceBridge addresses this gap by providing an accurate, inclusive, and accessible speech-to-control system that enables users to communicate with their devices using their speech, regardless of clarity of articulation. Building on familiar technology, such as personal computers and mobile devices, may be one of the most cost-effective and easily adoptable approaches for improving an individual with disability’s autonomy and access to the world around them. The rise of ASR technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrations in the industry provides a novel landscape of opportunities to improve accessibility interfaces. VoiceBridge exploits bleeding-edge technology for a practical and impactful application.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

Individuals with speech impairments currently rely on standard speech-to-text or manual input to use browsers and devices. Existing systems struggle with slurred or atypical speech, often requiring caregiver assistance.

Typical workarounds include typing commands, using alternative inputs, or correcting errors, leading to frustration and limited autonomy.

Current workflow:
User speaks → Standard recognition → Frequent errors → Manual/caregiver correction → Action executed

VoiceBridge aims to replace this with accurate transcription, command mapping, and immediate feedback, enabling independent browser control.

\section{Look and Feel Requirements}
\subsection{Appearance Requirements}
The interface shall have a clean and minimal design to reduce cognitive load. Key elements should be visually distinct, with consistent spacing, and color usage to support quick recognition of actions.

Since it’s a browser integration, the user interface should minimally interfere with the visibility of the content on the page. The interface should only capture the user’s attention as functionally needed (i.e., listening to user prompts, confirming user intent), but should otherwise blend in with the browser interface.

\subsection{Style Requirements}
The system shall maintain a professional and neutral visual style suitable for general workplace use. Colors, icons, and fonts should prioritize clarity over branding at this stage. Future iterations may incorporate custom styling or theming.


\section{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\section{Open Issues}
The primary open issue is maintaining high ASR accuracy across the diverse and severe spectrum of dysarthric speech. This requires extensive training and validation data, as well as careful model tuning.


\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
The project will evaluate existing, specialized speech recognition models and applications (e.g., Whisper model and Project Euphonia) as performance baselines.

\subsection{Reusable Components}
Potential reused components could include existing Text-to-Speech (TTS) modules for feedback and LLMs to map user commands into structured actions.

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
Open-source browser automation agents (e.g., The AI browser agent) may be integrated for command execution via voice input.


\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The product shall operate without modifying the user’s OS, browser, or network configuration. This separation prevents unintended impact from incorrect commands.

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
The product shall not bypass firewalls, alter security settings, access banned sites, install untrusted content, or perform any malware execution.

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
Due to the non-deterministic nature of dysarthric speech patterns, a user’s exact speech type may not be fully captured by the model, leading to higher training overhead for personalization before the system becomes reliably usable for them. Users may experience misinterpretations requiring retries, which can cause frustration.

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
Variability in dysarthric speech may necessitate frequent retraining of ASR models.

Real-time performance varies between devices, depending on processing power and low-latency operation.
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
The local operation limits the ability to perform remote problem diagnosis if any issues arise.


\section{Tasks}
\subsection{Project Planning}
Breakdown of major tasks:

Our main tasks are centered on preparing the system by training and tuning the dysarthric ASR model, integrating the core command interpreter, designing the accessible interface, and conducting rigorous testing.
\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}
A detailed schedule of development phases, milestones, and dependencies is outlined in the PoC and Development Plan.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
The system shall support new users with no prior ASR and interpreter experience through an onboarding process. 

The system shall support transitioning users migrating from an existing system by allowing for easy uploading of recordings of their speech training data.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
All previous transcripts, audio files, and personalization data shall be tied to secure user accounts.

Users shall be able to access their data from any supported device after logging in and authentication.

\section{Costs}
The primary costs for this product are related to machine learning computation and hosting. Development and training will initially leverage Compute Canada credits provided by the supervising research team, along with Colab Pro (CAD 13.99/month).

No external hosting costs are anticipated for the initial release; however, optional hosting may be required for commercial distribution and deployments. If hosting is included, approximate costs for cloud-based deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) include: training and inference on GPUs (~\$50 CAD/month for pilot use), storage (~\$3 CAD/month), and minimal networking (~\$2–5 CAD/month). Costs scale with the number of users and training frequency. All estimates are approximate and intended for planning purposes.
\section{User Documentation and Training}
\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
The system shall provide clear, accessible documentation, including an instructional guide and FAQ. (As noted in Section 14b, supporting requirements already cover this in detail.)

\subsection{Training Requirements}
Training shall not require formal instruction; the documentation and interface shall support self-directed onboarding.

\section{Waiting Room}
The system shall display launch, loading, or processing pages during transitions to provide users with clear feedback and reduce confusion during waiting periods.

\section{Ideas for Solution}

\subsection{Browser-Based Extensions}
The product is primarily web-based. Future considerations could include desktop or mobile apps to broaden the scope and accessibility (see Section 13 for environment and interface requirements).

\subsection{Personalized ASR Fine-Tuning}
Consider incremental model tuning paired with real-time streaming of speech input. This could be an approach to adapt to individual speech patterns while minimizing the training time overhead, related to the adaptability requirements discussed in earlier sections.

\subsection{LLM Command Mapping}
User intent parsing via context-aware LLMs could improve natural language command interpretation, as mentioned in Section 13.

\subsection{Noise Filtering}
Beyond stationary noise, adaptive filtering techniques could be adapted to enhance recognition in busier environments. Section 13 already specifies stationary noise handling.

\subsection{Open-Source Integrations}
Potential use of browser automation or voice control frameworks can be investigated, as mentioned in Section 16 for off-the-shelf solutions.

\subsection{Accessibility Enhancements}
Additional visual, auditory, or haptic cues for feedback and help features could enhance usability. Section 14 highlights basic supportability requirements that these enhancements would build on.

\subsection{Data Encryption}
Anonymized logging and privacy approaches can balance model improvement with privacy in mind. Section 15 discusses privacy requirements in detail.
