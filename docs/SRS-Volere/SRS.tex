\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}


Individuals with speech impairments face significant barriers when interacting with digital devices. VoiceBridge addresses this gap by providing an accurate, inclusive, and accessible speech-to-control system that enables users to communicate with their devices using their speech, regardless of clarity of articulation. Building on familiar technology, such as personal computers and mobile devices, may be one of the most cost-effective and easily adoptable approaches for improving an individual with disability’s autonomy and access to the world around them. The rise of automatic speach recognition (ASR)  technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) integrations in the industry provides a novel landscape of opportunities to improve accessibility interfaces. VoiceBridge exploits bleeding-edge technology for a practical and impactful application.

\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}

Individuals with speech impairments currently rely on standard speech-to-text or manual input to use browsers and devices. Existing systems struggle with slurred or atypical speech, often requiring caregiver assistance.

Typical workarounds include typing commands, using alternative inputs, or correcting errors, leading to frustration and limited autonomy.

Current workflow:
User speaks → Standard recognition → Frequent errors → Manual/caregiver correction → Action executed

VoiceBridge aims to replace this with accurate transcription, command mapping, and immediate feedback, enabling independent browser control.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{FR1: Accept Speech Audio via Microphone}
\textbf{Description:} The system must capture live speech input from the user through a standard built-in or external microphone.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} Without microphone input, the system cannot acquire the user’s speech for transcription. Requiring only standard/built-in microphones keeps the solution accessible and affordable.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system reliably detects and records audio from default OS microphone devices across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, with a minimum 16 kHz sampling rate.

\bigskip
\subsection{FR2: Convert Impaired Speech to Text with greater than or equal to 80\% Accuracy (MVP)}
\textbf{Description:} The system must process the captured audio and output a textual representation of the spoken utterance.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} Accurate transcription is the core functionality that enables communication and command execution. Without acceptable accuracy, the product fails its purpose.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} In evaluation on a test dataset of impaired speech, transcription accuracy must reach at least 80\% word error rate (WER) reduction compared to baseline models, and achieve greater than or equal to 80\% accuracy for common commands.

\bigskip
\subsection{FR3: Display Transcription for Verification}
\textbf{Description:} The transcribed text must be displayed in real time on the user’s device interface.\\
\textbf{Rationale:} Transparent feedback allows the user to verify correctness, catch errors, and build trust in the system.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} Every spoken input is displayed within 2 seconds as text on the UI, with at least 95\% consistency across trials.

\bigskip
\subsection{FR4: Map Text to Arbitrary Device Commands}
\textbf{Description:} The system must recognize when transcribed text corresponds to a predefined device action (e.g., “open amazon.ca,” “draft a new email”) and translate it into the appropriate command representation (API, CLI, or accessibility call).\\
\textbf{Rationale:} Mapping allows the system to extend beyond communication into real device control, empowering user independence.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} For a test set of 50 predefined commands, the system maps user input to the correct command representation in at least 90\% of cases.

\bigskip
\subsection{FR5: Execute Commands on the Host Device}
\textbf{Description:} The system must execute the mapped commands through the host device’s accessibility framework or APIs, resulting in visible user action (e.g., app launch, scrolling, text entry).\\
\textbf{Rationale:} Without execution, the system remains a transcription tool only. Execution closes the loop between speech input and device interaction.\\
\textbf{Fit Criterion:} For each correctly recognized command, the intended system action occurs on the device within 2 seconds, with greater than or equal to 95\% reliability across test scenarios.

\subsection{LLM Command Mapping}
User intent parsing via context-aware LLMs could improve natural language command interpretation, as mentioned in Section 13.

\subsection{Noise Filtering}
Beyond stationary noise, adaptive filtering techniques could be adapted to enhance recognition in busier environments. Section 13 already specifies stationary noise handling.

\subsection{Open-Source Integrations}
Potential use of browser automation or voice control frameworks can be investigated, as mentioned in Section 16 for off-the-shelf solutions.

\subsection{Accessibility Enhancements}
Additional visual, auditory, or haptic cues for feedback and help features could enhance usability. Section 14 highlights basic supportability requirements that these enhancements would build on.

\subsection{Data Encryption}
Anonymized logging and privacy approaches can balance model improvement with privacy in mind. Section 15 discusses privacy requirements in detail.

\noindent This phased plan ensures that feasibility and safety are validated early (PoC), usability and inclusivity are developed next (Revision 0), and full scalability, compliance, and maintainability are achieved in the final iteration (Revision 1).




\section{Formal Specification}

This section provides a simplified formal model of the VoiceBridge system using a state-based representation.  
The goal is to describe how the system transitions between major states during operation.

\subsection{System States}

Let the system have the following states:

\[
Q = \{Idle, Listening, Processing, Confirming, Executing, Error\}
\]

The system starts in the \textit{Idle} state and reacts to user or system inputs.

\subsection{Inputs and Transitions}

Inputs to the system are represented as:

\[
\Sigma = \{Start, AudioInput, Confirm, Reject, Execute, Fail\}
\]

The transition function $\delta(q, \sigma)$ describes how the system changes state:

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\delta(Idle, Start) = Listening \\
\delta(Listening, AudioInput) = Processing \\
\delta(Processing, Confirm) = Executing \\
\delta(Processing, Reject) = Listening \\
\delta(Executing, Execute) = Idle \\
\delta(Executing, Fail) = Error
\end{array}
\]

\subsection{Output Behavior}

Each state produces a specific output:

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
Idle \rightarrow \text{System ready prompt} \\
Listening \rightarrow \text{Microphone active} \\
Processing \rightarrow \text{Speech to text conversion} \\
Confirming \rightarrow \text{User verification message} \\
Executing \rightarrow \text{Command execution feedback} \\
Error \rightarrow \text{Error or retry prompt}
\end{array}
\]

\subsection{Mapping to Requirements}

This formal model represents the main workflow of VoiceBridge and aligns with the following functional requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item FR1: Accept Speech Input ($Idle \rightarrow Listening$)
    \item FR2: Convert Speech to Text ($Listening \rightarrow Processing$)
    \item FR3: Confirm Transcription ($Processing \rightarrow Confirming$)
    \item FR4: Map Intent to Command ($Confirming \rightarrow Executing$)
    \item FR5: Execute Command ($Executing \rightarrow Idle$)
\end{itemize}

This simplified formalization shows how user input moves through each stage of the system in a predictable, testable way, ensuring clarity and correctness of behavior.
