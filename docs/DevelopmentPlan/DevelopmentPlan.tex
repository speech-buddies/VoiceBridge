\begin{comment}\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}
\end{comment}

This report outlines VoiceBridge’s project details, including an overview of the licensing, team norms, proof of concept plan, and the expected technology that’ll be utilized throughout the development phase.

\begin{comment}\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

  \begin{comment}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
  \item 
\end{comment}
  
The team will use Git and GitHub for version control, to manage issues, and to handle pull requests. During the weekly meetings, the team will create a list of issues to complete. This will follow an issue template with a description that includes the Definition of Done (DoD), an assignee, a reviewer, as well as the source/purpose of the issue and any related dependencies or issues. Issues will follow a naming convention which will be included in the associated development branch. Commits will also include the issue number for traceability purposes.

\noindent To keep an organized project, PRs will be merged to main after a reviewer approves that the DoD has been met. Tests will be required where applicable in the DoD. The issue will be linked in the PR description.

Issues will be used to track all tasks, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development
    \item Tests
    \item Team meetings
    \item Deliverable Submissions
    \item Infrastructure Setup
    \item Resolving Bugs
    \item Addressing Supervisor Feedback
\end{itemize}

The branch names will include a prefix to specify the type of issue worked on, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item feature/*
    \item bug/*
    \item infra/*
    \item docs/*
\end{itemize}

Once the assignee is confident with their completed issue, they will notify the reviewer and address potential feedback/concerns the reviewer may raise. After the assignee and reviewer agree on the issue completion, the issue owner will notify the team that it is complete.


Our team will use GitHub Actions to automate testing and maintain code quality standards. The CI pipeline will run unit tests on core functionality to ensure that bugs aren’t introduced, and existing components are working as expected. A linting tool will be added to maintain consistent styling and to review code for potential errors.

PRs must pass all tests and lint checks before developers request review. Branch protection rules will prevent merging until a minimum of 1 PR approval is added.

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}
\begin{comment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}
\end{comment}

The project will be organized on GitHub projects, with a linked Kanban-board to visualize issue completion. Swimlanes will be used to show the stage of the issue, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backlog:} issues which have been identified and created
    \item \textbf{To Do:} lists issues which need to be done before the next meeting, have been groomed by 1 or more team members
    \item \textbf{In Progress:} issues that have been started
    \item \textbf{In Review:} development is complete, awaiting feedback (assigned to reviewer)
    \item \textbf{Done:} DoD is met, and team is informed of completion
\end{itemize}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}
\begin{comment}
\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}
\end{comment}

We expect to use \textbf{Python} as the programming language. 

We plan to use \textbf{PyTorch} or \textbf{TensorFlow} for model fine-tuning. We will extend and fine-tune existing models trained on standard speech, adapting them to accurately process dysarthric speech.

We will use the \textbf{PyLint} linter to ensure pull requests meet coding standards.

Testing will be done with \textbf{Pytest}.

For code coverage, we will use \textbf{coverage.py}.

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Environment:} For model training, proof of concepts, and performance testing, we will use Google Colab for convenience and ease of use. The final application will likely require a managed Python environment, such as \textbf{Conda}, to handle custom dependencies and allow easy local integration of project components.

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Compute Resources:} Since the project may involve handling large amounts of data during training and tuning, we plan to use McMaster CAS GPU clusters. Alternatively, we may consider Google Colab Pro, which offers pay-as-you-go compute units.


\section{Coding Standard}

%\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}
We will follow the \href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/}{PEP 8} coding standard.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?
    
    Luna:

CI/CD simplifies the integration of changes by automating the repetitive tasks of building and testing code, reducing the manual effort needed. It provides insights on the project’s health, making it easier to track and resolve conflicts early. 

However, using CI/CD is ineffective without maintaining an up-to-date testing suite (~95%+ coverage). Configuring the pipeline and resolving issues could be time consuming and might slow development progress.
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?

    We did not have disagreements in this deliverable. We were able to delegate tasks, and complete them ahead of our meetings, which allowed us to review the work when we met. This helped us stay on track, and avoid any coflicts. 
\end{enumerate}
