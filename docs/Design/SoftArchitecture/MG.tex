\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.   For VoiceBridge, we adopt this decomposition based fundamentally on Parnas’s principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  This approach supports design for change, a critical concern in assistive technologies where adaptation to evolving user needs and cutting-edge speech recognition improvements frequently occur, especially in early development phases.

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:]
Consumer-grade hardware platform and input devices. \\
VoiceBridge is expected to run on a range of consumer-grade devices (desktops, laptops, tablets) with standard microphones and evolving OS audio stacks. Variations in microphone quality, form factor, and host processing capabilities, as well as future improvements in consumer audio hardware, should be handled by the audio acquisition and preprocessing modules (e.g., Microphone Manager and VAD/NoiseFilter) without impacting higher layers.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSpeechModel}:]
Speech-to-text engine and language support. \\
The system might expand to support additional languages and dialects beyond English requiring adaptations in ASR models and intent interpretation logic. Continuous improvements in speech recognition accuracy and noise filtering will also necessitate regular updates.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUserPersonalization}:]
User profile and personalization management. \\
Personalization features may evolve to accommodate changing user speech patterns and preferences, demanding updates in model fine-tuning, adaptive prompting based on confidence, and profile management strategies.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acCommandSupport}:]
Command mapping and browser automation protocols. \\
Browser capabilities, permission models, and automation interfaces (such as extension manifests and scripting APIs) are expected to evolve over time. New commands, revised command schemas, and updated browser/OS integration will require changes localized to the Command Mapping, Command Execution, and Browser Controller modules, which are designed to isolate such API-level changes from the rest of the system.


\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUIAndAccessibility}:]
User interface and accessibility compliance. \\
Responsive adjustments to UI designs and accessibility layers will be required to stay compliant with evolving WCAG guidelines and to address user feedback for improved usability.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acErrorHandling}:]
Error handling and recovery policies. \\
Classification schemes, messaging protocols, retry/backoff strategies, and compensation mechanisms may be enhanced to increase robustness and user experience quality.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acSessionManagement}:]
Session lifecycle and interaction flow. \\
Changes may extend session duration limits, improve state persistence, and better handle asynchronous or interrupted user interactions.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDataPrivacyLogging}:]
Data privacy, audit logging, and security. \\
Adaptations will be necessary to comply with evolving data privacy laws and security best practices, affecting encryption, audit trail formats, and consent mechanisms.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acPersonalizationLayer}:]
Personalization and prompting enhancements. \\
Enhancements aiming at more context-aware and confidence-driven user assistance will continually refine prompting and instruction modules.

\end{description}


% \wss{Anticipated changes relate to changes that would be made in requirements,
% design or implementation choices.  They are not related to changes that are made
% at run-time, like the values of parameters.}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucHardwarePlatform}:]
Switching to specialized or non-consumer deployment platforms. \\
VoiceBridge is designed to run on consumer-grade devices using standard microphones and common operating systems. Supporting specialized assistive hardware would require major changes to hardware assumptions, certification, and system integration, and is out of scope for this project.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucProcessingOffload}:]
Offloading speech processing or command execution to external or cloud systems. \\
To protect user privacy and maintain responsiveness, VoiceBridge performs all key processing locally. Changing this would require major architecture redesign and is not planned.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucASRMethod}:]
Fundamental changes to the speech recognition approach. \\
The system uses speech recognition models adapted for users with speech impairments. Major changes to the recognition method—such as replacing local processing with a fully cloud-based approach—would be disruptive and are not planned.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucCommandSystem}:]
Complete redesign of command mapping and browser control modules. \\
The system uses a browser-bridge automation pattern, with dedicated modules (Command Mapping, Command Execution, Browser Controller) that encapsulate browser APIs and OS integration. Updates to support new browser APIs or extensions are expected, but replacing the underlying automation architecture is not planned.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucArchitecture}:]
Abandoning modular design for a monolithic or radically different architecture. \\
Modularity was chosen for maintainability and scalability. Changing to a less modular approach would increase complexity and reduce flexibility.

\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. The system is organized into architectural layers, each containing modules that encapsulate specific responsibilities.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

% \wss{The uses relation is not a data flow diagram.  In the code there will often
% be an import statement in module A when it directly uses module B.  Module B
% provides the services that module A needs.  The code for module A needs to be
% able to see these services (hence the import statement).  Since the uses
% relation is transitive, there is a use relation without an import, but the
% arrows in the diagram typically correspond to the presence of import statement.}

% \wss{If module A uses module B, the arrow is directed from A to B.}

\section{Timeline}

% \wss{Schedule of tasks and who is responsible}

The project is divided into phases with clear objectives, and all tasks are handled collaboratively — there is no single module ownership.

\subsection{Development Phases}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Foundational Development Phase (September -- October 2025):} 
    Core functionality such as speech-to-text, intent interpretation, and command mapping was developed collectively.
    
    \item \textbf{Integration and Testing Phase (November -- December 2025):} 
    The team works together to integrate modules, improve accessibility, and optimize performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Task Responsibilities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Speech recognition and intent interpretation
    \item Command mapping and system integration
    \item User interface and accessibility
    \item Testing and performance optimization
    \item Documentation and support
\end{itemize}

All tasks are executed collaboratively, ensuring shared responsibility and smooth progress.
